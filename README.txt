This is a description of the data and programs used in the experiments of the paper entitled "Subnetwork reliability of the arrangement graphs under probabilistic fault condition (https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4789546)" .

Instructions:

The Validity analysis of the upper and lower bounds of R_{n,k}^m(p) in Table 2 of the paper is obtained by the program "validity analysis_nkm.m".

Algorithm 1 in the paper is implemented as "algorithm1.m".

The results displayed in Figure 2 are obtained by the program "minimum.m".

The results displayed in Figure 3 are obtained by the programs in the folder "Comparison of approximate evaluation results and bounds of the R_{n,k}^m(p)".

Algorithm 2 in the paper is implemented as "algorithm2.m".

All datasets used in the paper are located in the folder "Datasets" (for example, "data541.mat" in the file is the dataset D(A_{5,4}^{1}).

The results displayed in Figure 5 are obtained by the programs "node_nkm.m" and "node_fig.m".

The results displayed in Figure 6 are obtained by the programs "lr_nkm.m" and "lr_fig.m".

The mean values of root mean square errors on distinct test samples in Table 4 of the paper are obtained by the programs "RMSE_nkm.m" and "RMSE_MergedDataset.m".

The results displayed in Figure 7 are obtained by the programs in the folder "Curves of actual values and evaluation results of R_{n,k}^m(p) for some datasets". 

The results displayed in Figure 8 are obtained by the programs in the folder "Comparison of actual values and evaluation results of R_{n,k}^m(p) for distinct datasets".

The results displayed in Figure 9 are obtained by the program "Comparison_MergedDatasets.m".

The total times of two methods and root mean square errors of the results obtained by the constructed model in Table 5 of the paper are obtained by the program "time_nkm.m".
